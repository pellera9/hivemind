/**
 * Per-file extraction cache (Phase 1.5).
 *
 * Phase 1's `runBuildCommand` re-parsed every source file on every invocation
 * (full rebuild, ~2.5s for 280 files on hivemind). With the cache, unchanged
 * files load their FileExtraction from disk in microseconds — full rebuild on
 * 1-file-changed drops to ~85ms (~30× faster).
 *
 * Cache layout:
 *   ~/.hivemind/graphs/<repo-key>/.cache/<content-sha256>.json
 *     where content-sha256 = sha256(utf8(file content)) — NOT path-derived.
 *     Same content across files / branches / users shares one entry.
 *
 * Invalidation: content-addressed by definition. Different content → different
 * key → no stale reads possible. Pruning is deferred to a later phase; the
 * cache grows but only by one entry per distinct file content ever seen.
 *
 * Schema versioning: cache entries embed `extractor_schema` so a bump in the
 * extractor output shape (e.g., adding a new edge relation) invalidates the
 * old entries automatically — readers ignore mismatched-schema entries and
 * fall through to re-extraction.

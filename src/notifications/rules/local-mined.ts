/**
 * Surfaces locally-mined skills to fresh, not-signed-in users — the
 * user-visible half of the "wow effect" pair. The not-logged-in branch of
 * session-start.ts already injects the same content into `additionalContext`
 * so the MODEL sees it; this rule turns it into a `systemMessage` so the
 * USER sees it in their terminal too, exactly like the welcome line shown
 * right after `hivemind login`.
 *
 * Two branches:
 *   1. A recent manifest entry carries an `insight` string → render the
 *      concrete-insight banner (the gate's quantified finding + the
 *      minted skill name + sign-in CTA). This is the conversion surface —
 *      a real pattern from the user's own work, not an abstract count.
 *   2. No insight available (legacy manifest, gate didn't emit one) →
 *      fall back to the legacy "🎉 N skills mined" copy. Behavior on
 *      pre-insight manifests is unchanged.
 *
 * Suppression: stays silent once creds are present (logged-in users see
 * the welcome rule instead) or when the manifest is absent / empty.
 *
 * Dedup: insight branch keys on skill_name + created_at so a new insight
 * refires next session; count branch keys on the integer count so an
 * incrementing N refires too.

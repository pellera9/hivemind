/**
 * Public API for the notifications framework.
 *
 * Two production code paths use this module:
 *   1. The hook entry point (e.g. src/hooks/session-notifications.ts) calls
 *      drainSessionStart() once per session start.
 *   2. Any code path can call enqueueNotification() at any time to push
 *      a notification onto the persistent queue, drained at the next session.
 *
 * Rule registration (registerRule) currently happens at module-load time
 * inside drainSessionStart's caller — see hooks/session-notifications.ts.
 * Rules are pure (no IO) so a cold registry-evaluation has zero side effects
 * if no rule fires.

 * processes can race this function. State dedup (`alreadyShown`) protects
 * against duplicate emission ONLY if one process completes its write
 * before the other reads — not guaranteed. We additionally call
 * `tryClaim()` per notification: an atomic O_CREAT|O_EXCL on a claim file
 * for each (id, dedupKey) pair. First process wins, second skips.

 * Failures are caught and logged — never thrown. A broken notifications
 * pipeline must not abort the SessionStart hook process (the existing
